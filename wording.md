# Proposed Wording

## Execution Support Library

### General

This Clause describes components supporting execution of function objects [function.objects].

*(The following definition appears in working draft N4762 [thread.req.lockable.general])*

> An *execution agent* is an entity such as a thread that may perform work in parallel with other execution agents. [*Note:* Implementations or users may introduce other kinds of agents such as processes or thread-pool tasks. *--end note*] The calling agent is determined by context; e.g., the calling thread that contains the call, and so on. 

An execution agent invokes a function object within an *execution context* such as the calling thread or thread-pool.  An *executor* submits a function object to an execution context to be invoked by an execution agent within that execution context. [*Note:* Invocation of the function object may be inlined such as when the execution context is the calling thread, or may be scheduled such as when the execution context is a thread-pool with task scheduler. *--end note*] An executor may submit a function object with *execution properties* that specify how the submission and invocation of the function object interacts with the submitting thread and execution context, including forward progress guarantees [intro.progress]. 

For the intent of this library and extensions to this library, the *lifetime of an execution agent* begins before the function object is invoked and ends after this invocation completes, either normally or having thrown an exception.

## Requirements

### `ProtoAllocator` requirements

A type `A` meets the `ProtoAllocator` requirements if `A` is `CopyConstructible` (C++Std [copyconstructible]), `Destructible` (C++Std [destructible]), and `allocator_traits<A>::rebind_alloc<U>` meets the allocator requirements (C++Std [allocator.requirements]), where `U` is an object type. [*Note:* For example, `std::allocator<void>` meets the proto-allocator requirements but not the allocator requirements. *--end note*] No comparison operator, copy operation, move operation, or swap operation on these types shall exit via an exception.

### Invocable archetype

The name `execution::invocable_archetype` is an implementation-defined type such that `invocable<execution::invocable_archetype&>` is `true`.

A program that creates an instance of `execution::invocable_archetype` is ill-formed.

### Customization points

#### `execution::set_value`

The name `execution::set_value` denotes a customization point object. The expression `execution::set_value(R, Vs...)` for some subexpressions `R` and `Vs...` is expression-equivalent to:

- `R.set_value(Vs...)`, if that expression is valid. If the function selected does not send the value(s) `Vs...` to the receiver `R`'s value channel, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

- Otherwise, `set_value(R, Vs...)`, if that expression is valid, with overload resolution performed in a context that includes the declaration

        void set_value();

    and that does not include a declaration of `execution::set_value`. If the function selected by overload resolution does not send the value(s) `Vs...` to the receiver `R`'s value channel, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

- Otherwise, `execution::set_value(R, Vs...)` is ill-formed.

[*Editorial note:* We should probably define what "send the value(s) `Vs...` to the receiver `R`'s value channel" means more carefully. *--end editorial note*]

#### `execution::set_done`

The name `execution::set_done` denotes a customization point object. The expression `execution::set_done(R)` for some subexpression `R` is expression-equivalent to:

- `R.set_done()`, if that expression is valid. If the function selected does not signal the receiver `R`'s done channel, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

- Otherwise, `set_done(R)`, if that expression is valid, with overload resolution performed in a context that includes the declaration

        void set_done();

    and that does not include a declaration of `execution::set_done`. If the function selected by overload resolution does not signal the receiver `R`'s done channel, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

- Otherwise, `execution::set_done(R)` is ill-formed.

[*Editorial note:* We should probably define what "signal receiver `R`'s done channel" means more carefully. *--end editorial note*]

#### `execution::set_error`

The name `execution::set_error` denotes a customization point object. The expression `execution::set_error(R, E)` for some subexpressions `R` and `E` are expression-equivalent to:

- `R.set_error(E)`, if that expression is valid. If the function selected does not send the error `E` to the receiver `R`'s error channel, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

- Otherwise, `set_error(R, E)`, if that expression is valid, with overload resolution performed in a context that includes the declaration

        void set_error();

    and that does not include a declaration of `execution::set_error`. If the function selected by overload resolution does not send the error `E` to the receiver `R`'s error channel, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

- Otherwise, `execution::set_error(R, E)` is ill-formed.

[*Editorial note:* We should probably define what "send the error `E` to the receiver `R`'s error channel" means more carefully. *--end editorial note*]

#### `execution::execute`

The name `execution::execute` denotes a customization point object.

For some subexpressions `e` and `f`, let `E` be a type such that `decltype((e))` is `E` and let `F` be a type such that `decltype((f))` is `F`. The expression `execution::execute(e, f)` is ill-formed if `F` does not model `invocable`, or if `E` does not model either `executor` or `sender`. Otherwise, it is expression-equivalent to:

- `e.execute(f)`, if that expression is valid. If the function selected does not execute the function object `f` on the executor `e`, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

- Otherwise, `execute(e, f)`, if that expression is valid, with overload resolution performed in a context that includes the declaration

        void execute();

    and that does not include a declaration of `execution::execute`. If the function selected by overload resolution does not execute the function object `f` on the executor `e`, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

- Otherwise, if `F` is not an instance of _`as-invocable`_`<`_`R`_`, E>` for some type _`R`_, and `invocable<remove_cvref_t<F>&> && sender_to<E, `_`as-receiver`_`<remove_cvref_t<F>, E>>` is `true`, `execution::submit(e, `_`as-receiver`_`<remove_cvref_t<F>, E>{std::forward<F>(f)})`, where _`as-receiver`_ is some implementation-defined class template equivalent to:

        template<class F, class>
        struct as-receiver {
          F f_;
          void set_value() noexcept(is_nothrow_invocable_v<F&>) {
            invoke(f_);
          }
          [[noreturn]] void set_error(std::exception_ptr) noexcept {
            terminate();
          }
          void set_done() noexcept {}
        };

[*Editorial note:* We should probably define what "execute the function object `F` on the executor `E`" means more carefully. *--end editorial note*]

#### `execution::connect`

The name `execution::connect` denotes a customization point object. For some
subexpressions `s` and `r`, let `S` be a type such that `decltype((s))` is `S` and let `R`
be a type such that `decltype((r))` is `R`. The expression `execution::connect(s, r)` is
expression-equivalent to:

- `s.connect(r)`, if that expression is valid, if its type satisfies `operation_state`,
  and if `S` satisfies `sender`.

- Otherwise, `connect(s, r)`, if that expression is valid, if its type satisfies `operation_state`, and if `S` satisfies `sender`, with overload resolution performed in a context that includes the declaration

        void connect();

    and that does not include a declaration of `execution::connect`.

- Otherwise, _`as-operation`_`{s, r}`, if `r` is not an instance of
  _`as-receiver`_`<`_`F`_` , S>` for some type _`F`_, and if `receiver_of<R> &&`
  _`executor-of-impl`_`<remove_cvref_t<S>, `_`as-invocable`_`<remove_cvref_t<R>, S>>` is
  `true`, where _`as-operation`_ is an implementation-defined class equivalent to

        struct as-operation {
          remove_cvref_t<S> e_;
          remove_cvref_t<R> r_;
          void start() noexcept try {
            execution::execute(std::move(e_), as-invocable<remove_cvref_t<R>, S>{r_});
          } catch(...) {
            execution::set_error(std::move(r_), current_exception());
          }
        };

    and _`as-invocable`_ is a class template equivalent to the following:

        template<class R, class>
        struct as-invocable {
          R* r_;
          explicit as-invocable(R& r) noexcept
            : r_(std::addressof(r)) {}
          as-invocable(as-invocable && other) noexcept
            : r_(std::exchange(other.r_, nullptr)) {}
          ~as-invocable() {
            if(r_)
              execution::set_done(std::move(*r_));
          }
          void operator()() & noexcept try {
            execution::set_value(std::move(*r_));
            r_ = nullptr;
          } catch(...) {
            execution::set_error(std::move(*r_), current_exception());
            r_ = nullptr;
          }
        };

- Otherwise, `execution::connect(s, r)` is ill-formed.

#### `execution::start`

The name `execution::start` denotes a customization point object. The expression
`execution::start(O)` for some lvalue subexpression `O` is expression-equivalent to:

- `O.start()`, if that expression is valid.

- Otherwise, `start(O)`, if that expression is valid, with overload resolution performed
  in a context that includes the declaration

        void start();

    and that does not include a declaration of `execution::start`.

- Otherwise, `execution::start(O)` is ill-formed.

#### `execution::submit`

The name `execution::submit` denotes a customization point object.

For some subexpressions `s` and `r`, let `S` be a type such that `decltype((s))` is `S` and let `R` be a type such that `decltype((r))` is `R`. The expression `execution::submit(s, r)` is ill-formed if `sender_to<S, R>` is not `true`. Otherwise, it is expression-equivalent to:

- `s.submit(r)`, if that expression is valid and `S` models `sender`. If the function selected does not submit the receiver object `r` via the sender `s`, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

- Otherwise, `submit(s, r)`, if that expression is valid and `S` models `sender`, with overload resolution performed in a context that includes the declaration

        void submit();

    and that does not include a declaration of `execution::submit`. If the function selected by overload resolution does not submit the receiver object `r` via the sender `s`, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

- Otherwise, `execution::start((new `_`submit-receiver`_`<S, R>{s,r})->state_)`, where _`submit-receiver`_
is an implementation-defined class template equivalent to

        template<class S, class R>
        struct submit-receiver {
          struct wrap {
            submit-receiver * p_;
            template<class...As>
              requires receiver_of<R, As...>
            void set_value(As&&... as) && noexcept(is_nothrow_receiver_of_v<R, As...>) {
              execution::set_value(std::move(p_->r_), (As&&) as...);
              delete p_;
            }
            template<class E>
              requires receiver<R, E>
            void set_error(E&& e) && noexcept {
              execution::set_error(std::move(p_->r_), (E&&) e);
              delete p_;
            }
            void set_done() && noexcept {
              execution::set_done(std::move(p_->r_));
              delete p_;
            }
          };
          remove_cvref_t<R> r_;
          connect_result_t<S, wrap> state_;
          submit-receiver(S&& s, R&& r)
            : r_((R&&) r)
            , state_(execution::connect((S&&) s, wrap{this})) {}
        };


#### `execution::schedule`

The name `execution::schedule` denotes a customization point object. For some subexpression `s`, let `S` be a type such that `decltype((s))` is `S`. The expression `execution::schedule(s)` is expression-equivalent to:

- `s.schedule()`, if that expression is valid and its type models `sender`. 

- Otherwise, `schedule(s)`, if that expression is valid and its type models `sender`
  with overload resolution performed in a context that includes the declaration

        void schedule();

    and that does not include a declaration of `execution::schedule`. 

- Otherwise, _`as-sender`_`<remove_cvref_t<S>>{s}` if `S` satisfies `executor`, where _`as-sender`_ is an
implementation-defined class template equivalent to

        template<class E>
        struct as-sender {
        private:
          E ex_;
        public:
          template<template<class...> class Tuple, template<class...> class Variant>
            using value_types = Variant<Tuple<>>;
          template<template<class...> class Variant>
            using error_types = Variant<std::exception_ptr>;
          static constexpr bool sends_done = true;

          explicit as-sender(E e) noexcept
            : ex_((E&&) e) {}
          template<class R>
            requires receiver_of<R>
          connect_result_t<E, R> connect(R&& r) && {
            return execution::connect((E&&) ex_, (R&&) r);
          }
          template<class R>
            requires receiver_of<R>
          connect_result_t<const E &, R> connect(R&& r) const & {
            return execution::connect(ex_, (R&&) r);
          }
        };

- Otherwise, `execution::schedule(s)` is ill-formed.

#### `execution::bulk_execute`

The name `execution::bulk_execute` denotes a customization point object. If `is_convertible_v<N, size_t>` is true, then the expression `execution::bulk_execute(S, F, N)` for some subexpressions `S`, `F`, and `N` is expression-equivalent to:

- `S.bulk_execute(F, N)`, if that expression is valid. If the function selected does not execute `N` invocations of the function object `F` on the executor `S` in bulk with forward progress guarantee `std::query(S, execution::bulk_guarantee)`, and the result of that function does not model `sender<void>`, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

- Otherwise, `bulk_execute(S, F, N)`, if that expression is valid, with overload resolution performed in a context that includes the declaration

        void bulk_execute();

    and that does not include a declaration of `execution::bulk_execute`. If the function selected by overload resolution does not execute `N` invocations of the function object `F` on the executor `S` in bulk with forward progress guarantee `std::query(E, execution::bulk_guarantee)`, and the result of that function does not model `sender<void>`, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

- Otherwise, if the types `F` and `executor_index_t<remove_cvref_t<S>>` model `invocable` and if `std::query(S, execution::bulk_guarantee)` equals `execution::bulk_guarantee.unsequenced`, then
    - Evaluates `DECAY_COPY(std::forward<decltype(F)>(F))` on the calling thread to create a function object `cf`. [*Note:* Additional copies of `cf` may subsequently be created. *--end note.*]
    - For each value of `i` in `N`, `cf(i)` (or copy of `cf`)) will be invoked at most once by an execution agent that is unique for each value of `i`.
    - May block pending completion of one or more invocations of `cf`.
    - Synchronizes with (C++Std [intro.multithread]) the invocations of `cf`.

- Otherwise, `execution::bulk_execute(S, F, N)` is ill-formed.

[*Editorial note:* We should probably define what "execute `N` invocations of the function object `F` on the executor `S` in bulk" means more carefully. *--end editorial note*]

### Concepts `receiver` and `receiver_of`

A receiver represents the continuation of an asynchronous operation. An asynchronous operation may complete with a (possibly empty) set of values, an error, or it may be cancelled. A receiver has three principal operations corresponding to the three ways an asynchronous operation may complete: `set_value`, `set_error`, and `set_done`. These are collectively known as a receiver’s _completion-signal operations_.

        template<class T, class E = exception_ptr>
        concept receiver =
          move_constructible<remove_cvref_t<T>> &&
          constructible_from<remove_cvref_t<T>, T> &&
          requires(remove_cvref_t<T>&& t, E&& e) {
            { execution::set_done(std::move(t)) } noexcept;
            { execution::set_error(std::move(t), (E&&) e) } noexcept;
          };

        template<class T, class... An>
        concept receiver_of =
          receiver<T> &&
          requires(remove_cvref_t<T>&& t, An&&... an) {
            execution::set_value(std::move(t), (An&&) an...);
          };

The receiver’s completion-signal operations have semantic requirements that are collectively known as the _receiver contract_, described below:

- None of a receiver’s completion-signal operations shall be invoked before `execution::start` has been called on the operation state object that was returned by `execution::connect` to connect that receiver to a sender.

- Once `execution::start` has been called on the operation state object, exactly one of the receiver’s completion-signal operations shall complete non-exceptionally before the receiver is destroyed.

- If `execution::set_value` exits with an exception, it is still valid to call `execution::set_error` or `execution::set_done` on the receiver.

Once one of a receiver’s completion-signal operations has completed non-exceptionally, the receiver contract has been satisfied.

### Concept `operation_state`

        template<class O>
          concept operation_state =
            destructible<O> &&
            is_object_v<O> &&
            requires (O& o) {
              { execution::start(o) } noexcept;
            };

An object whose type satisfies `operation_state` represents the state of an asynchronous
operation. It is the result of calling `execution::connect` with a `sender` and a
`receiver`.

`execution::start` may be called on an `operation_state` object at most once. Once
`execution::start` has been invoked, the caller shall ensure that the start of a
non-exceptional invocation of one of the receiver's completion-signalling operations
strongly happens before [intro.multithread] the call to the `operation_state` destructor.

The start of the invocation of `execution::start` shall strongly happen before
[intro.multithread] the invocation of one of the three receiver operations.

`execution::start` may or may not block pending the successful transfer of execution to
one of the three receiver operations.

### Concepts `sender` and `sender_to`

XXX TODO The `sender` and `sender_to` concepts...

        template<class S>
          concept sender =
            move_constructible<remove_cvref_t<S>> &&
            !requires {
              typename sender_traits<remove_cvref_t<S>>::__unspecialized; // exposition only
            };

        template<class S, class R>
          concept sender_to =
            sender<S> &&
            receiver<R> &&
            requires (S&& s, R&& r) {
              execution::connect((S&&) s, (R&&) r);
            };

None of these operations shall introduce data races as a result of concurrent invocations of those functions from different threads.

A sender type's destructor shall not block pending completion of the submitted function objects. 
[*Note:* The ability to wait for completion of submitted function objects may be provided by the associated execution context. *--end note*]

### Concept `typed_sender`

A sender is _typed_ if it declares what types it sends through a receiver's channels.
The `typed_sender` concept is defined as:

        template<template<template<class...> class Tuple, template<class...> class Variant> class>
          struct has-value-types; // exposition only

        template<template<class...> class Variant>
          struct has-error-types; // exposition only

        template<class S>
          concept has-sender-types = // exposition only
            requires {
              typename has-value-types<S::template value_types>;
              typename has-error-types<S::template error_types>;
              typename bool_constant<S::sends_done>;
            };

        template<class S>
          concept typed_sender =
            sender<S> &&
            has-sender-types<sender_traits<remove_cvref_t<S>>>;

### Concept `scheduler`

XXX TODO The `scheduler` concept...

        template<class S>
          concept scheduler =
            copy_constructible<remove_cvref_t<S>> &&
            equality_comparable<remove_cvref_t<S>> &&
            requires(E&& e) {
              execution::schedule((S&&)s);
            };

None of a scheduler's copy constructor, destructor, equality comparison, or `swap`
operation shall exit via an exception.

None of these operations, nor an scheduler type's `schedule` function, or associated query
functions shall introduce data races as a result of concurrent invocations of those
functions from different threads.

For any two (possibly const) values `x1` and `x2` of some scheduler type `X`, `x1 == x2`
shall return `true` only if `x1.query(p) == x2.query(p)` for every property `p` where both
`x1.query(p)` and `x2.query(p)` are well-formed and result in a non-void type that is
`EqualityComparable` (C++Std [equalitycomparable]). [*Note:* The above requirements imply
that `x1 == x2` returns `true` if `x1` and `x2` can be interchanged with identical
effects. An scheduler may conceptually contain additional properties which are not exposed
by a named property type that can be observed via `execution::query`; in this case, it is
up to the concrete scheduler implementation to decide if these properties affect equality.
Returning `false` does not necessarily imply that the effects are not identical. *--end
note*]

An scheduler type's destructor shall not block pending completion of any receivers
submitted to the sender objects returned from `schedule`. [*Note:* The ability to wait for
completion of submitted function objects may be provided by the execution context that
produced the scheduler. *--end note*]

In addition to the above requirements, type `S` models `scheduler` only if it satisfies
the requirements in the Table below.

In the Table below, 

- `s` denotes a (possibly const) scheduler object of type `S`,
- `N` denotes a type that models `sender`, and
- `n` denotes a sender object of type `N`

| Expression | Return Type | Operational semantics |
|------------|-------------|---------------------- |
| `execution::schedule(s)` | `N` | Evaluates `execution::schedule(s)` on the calling thread to create `N`. |

`execution::start(o)`, where `o` is the result of a call to `execution::connect(N, r)`
for some receiver object `r`, is required to eagerly submit `r` for execution on an
execution agent that `s` creates for it. Let `rc` be `r` or an object created by copy or
move construction from `r`. The semantic constraints on the `sender` `N` returned from a
scheduler `s`'s `schedule` function are as follows:

* If `rc`'s `set_error` function is called in response to a submission error, scheduling
  error, or other internal error, let `E` be an expression that refers to that error if
  `set_error(rc, E)` is well-formed; otherwise, let `E` be an `exception_ptr` that refers
  to that error. [ _Note:_ `E` could be the result of calling `current_exception` or
  `make_exception_ptr` — _end note_ ] The scheduler calls `set_error(rc, E)` on an
  unspecified weakly-parallel execution agent ([ _Note:_ An invocation of `set_error` on a
  receiver is required to be `noexcept` — _end note_]), and

* If `rc`'s `set_error` function is called in response to an exception that
  propagates out of the invocation of `set_value` on `rc`, let `E` be
  `make_exception_ptr(receiver_invocation_error{})` invoked from within a catch clause
  that has caught the exception. The executor calls `set_error(rc, E)` on an unspecified
  weakly-parallel execution agent, and

* A call to `set_done(rc)` is made on an unspecified weakly-parallel execution agent ([
  _Note:_ An invocation of a receiver's `set_done` function is required to be `noexcept` —
  _end note_ ]).

[ Note: The senders returned from a scheduler's `schedule` function have wide discretion
when deciding which of the three receiver functions to call upon submission. — _end note_ ]

### Concepts `executor` and `executor_of`

XXX TODO The `executor` and `executor_of` concepts...

Let _`executor-of-impl`_ be the exposition-only concept

        template<class E, class F>
          concept executor-of-impl =
            invocable<remove_cvref_t<F>&> &&
            constructible_from<remove_cvref_t<F>, F> &&
            move_constructible<remove_cvref_t<F>> &&
            copy_constructible<E> &&
            is_nothrow_copy_constructible_v<E> &&
            equality_comparable<E> &&
            requires(const E& e, F&& f) {
              execution::execute(e, (F&&)f);
            };

Then,

        template<class E>
          concept executor =
            executor-of-impl<E, execution::invocable_archetype>;

        template<class E, class F>
          concept executor_of =
            executor<E> &&
            executor-of-impl<E, F>;

Neither of an executor's equality comparison or `swap` operation shall exit via an exception.

None of an executor type's copy constructor, destructor, equality comparison, `swap` function, `execute` function, or associated `query` functions shall introduce data races as a result of concurrent invocations of those functions from different threads.

For any two (possibly const) values `x1` and `x2` of some executor type `X`, `x1 == x2` shall return `true` only if `std::query(x1,p) == std::query(x2,p)` for every property `p` where both `std::query(x1,p)` and `std::query(x2,p)` are well-formed and result in a non-void type that is `equality_comparable` (C++Std [equalitycomparable]). [*Note:* The above requirements imply that `x1 == x2` returns `true` if `x1` and `x2` can be interchanged with identical effects. An executor may conceptually contain additional properties which are not exposed by a named property type that can be observed via `std::query`; in this case, it is up to the concrete executor implementation to decide if these properties affect equality. Returning `false` does not necessarily imply that the effects are not identical. *--end note*]

An executor type's destructor shall not block pending completion of the submitted function objects. [*Note:* The ability to wait for completion of submitted function objects may be provided by the associated execution context. *--end note*]

In addition to the above requirements, types `E` and `F` model `executor_of` only if they satisfy the requirements of the Table below.

In the Table below, 

- `e` denotes a (possibly const) executor object of type `E`,
- `cf` denotes the function object `DECAY_COPY(std::forward<F>(f))` 
- `f` denotes a function of type `F&&` invocable as `cf()` and where `decay_t<F>` models `move_constructible`.

| Expression | Return Type | Operational semantics |
|------------|-------------|---------------------- |
| `execution::execute(e, f)` | `void` | Evaluates `DECAY_COPY(std::forward<F>(f))` on the calling thread to create `cf` that will be invoked at most once by an execution agent. <br/> May block pending completion of this invocation. <br/> Synchronizes with [intro.multithread] the invocation of `f`. <br/>Shall not propagate any exception thrown by the function object or any other function submitted to the executor. [*Note:* The treatment of exceptions thrown by one-way submitted functions is implementation-defined. The forward progress guarantee of the associated execution agent(s) is implementation-defined. *--end note.*] |

[*Editorial note:* The operational semantics of `execution::execute` should be specified with the `execution::execute` CPO rather than the `executor` concept. *--end note.*]

### Sender and receiver traits

#### Class template `sender_traits`

XXX TODO The class template`sender_traits`...

The class template `sender_traits` can be used to query information about a `sender`; in
particular, what values and errors it sends through a receiver's value and error channel,
and whether or not it ever calls `set_done` on a receiver.

The primary `sender_traits<S>` class template is defined as if inheriting from an
implementation-defined class template _`sender-traits-base`_`<S>` defined as follows:

- Let _`has-sender-types`_ be an implementation-defined concept equivalent to:

        template<template<template<class...> class, template<class...> class> class>
          struct has-value-types ; // exposition only

        template<template<template<class...> class> class>
          struct has-error-types ; // exposition only

        template<class S>
          concept has-sender-types =
            requires {
              typename has-value-types <S::template value_types>;
              typename has-error-types <S::template error_types>;
              typename bool_constant<S::sends_done>;
            };

    If _`has-sender-types`_`<S>` is true, then _`sender-traits-base`_ is equivalent to:

        template<class S>
          struct sender-traits-base {
            template<template<class...> class Tuple, template<class...> class Variant>
              using value_types = typename S::template value_types<Tuple, Variant>;

            template<template<class...> class Variant>
              using error_types = typename S::template error_types<Variant>;

            static constexpr bool sends_done = S::sends_done;
          };

- Otherwise, let _`void-receiver`_ be an implementation-defined class type equivalent to

        struct void-receiver { // exposition only
          void set_value() noexcept;
          void set_error(exception_ptr) noexcept;
          void set_done() noexcept;
        };

    If _`executor-of-impl`_`<S, `_`as-invocable`_`<`_`void-receiver`_`, S>>` is `true`, then _`sender-traits-base`_ is equivalent to

        template<class S>
          struct sender-traits-base {
            template<template<class...> class Tuple, template<class...> class Variant>
              using value_types = Variant<Tuple<>>;

            template<template<class...> class Variant>
              using error_types = Variant<exception_ptr>;

            static constexpr bool sends_done = true;
          };

- Otherwise, if `derived_from<S, sender_base>` is `true`, then _`sender-traits-base`_ is
  equivalent to

        template<class S>
          struct sender-traits-base {};

- Otherwise, _`sender-traits-base`_ is equivalent to

        template<class S>
          struct sender-traits-base {
            using __unspecialized = void; // exposition only
          };

Because a sender may send one set of types or another to a receiver based on some runtime
condition, `sender_traits` may provide a nested `value_types` template that is
parameterized on a tuple-like class template and a variant-like class template that are
used to hold the result.

[_Example:_ If a sender type `S` sends types `As...` or `Bs...` to a receiver's value channel, it
may specialize `sender_traits` such that `typename sender_traits<S>::value_types<tuple, variant>`
names the type `variant<tuple<As...>, tuple<Bs...>>` -- _end example_]

Because a sender may send one or another type of error types to a receiver, `sender_traits`
may provide a nested `error_types` template that is parameterized on a variant-like class
template that is used to hold the result.

[_Example:_ If a sender type `S` sends error types `exception_ptr` or `error_code` to a
receiver's error channel, it may specialize `sender_traits` such that
`typename sender_traits<S>::error_types<variant>` names the type
`variant<exception_ptr, error_code>` -- _end example_]

A sender type can signal that it never calls `set_done` on a receiver by specializing
`sender_traits` such that `sender_traits<S>::sends_done` is `false`; conversely, it may
set `sender_traits<S>::sends_done` to `true` to indicate that it does call `set_done`
on a receiver.

Users may specialize `sender_traits` on program-defined types.

### Query-only properties

#### Associated execution context property

    struct context_t
    {
      template <class T>
        static constexpr bool is_applicable_property_v = executor<T>;

      static constexpr bool is_requirable = false;
      static constexpr bool is_preferable = false;
    
      using polymorphic_query_result_type = any;
    
      template<class Executor>
        static constexpr decltype(auto) static_query_v
          = Executor::query(context_t());
    };

The `context_t` property can be used only with `query`, which returns the execution context associated with the executor.

The value returned from `std::query(e, context_t)`, where `e` is an executor, shall not change between invocations.

#### Polymorphic executor wrappers

The `any_executor` class template provides polymorphic wrappers for executors.

In several places in this section the operation `CONTAINS_PROPERTY(p, pn)` is used. All such uses mean `std::disjunction_v<std::is_same<p, pn>...>`.

In several places in this section the operation `FIND_CONVERTIBLE_PROPERTY(p, pn)` is used. All such uses mean the first type `P` in the parameter pack `pn` for which `std::is_convertible_v<p, P>` is `true`. If no such type `P` exists, the operation `FIND_CONVERTIBLE_PROPERTY(p, pn)` is ill-formed.

```
template <class... SupportableProperties>
class any_executor
{
public:
  // construct / copy / destroy:

  any_executor() noexcept;
  any_executor(nullptr_t) noexcept;
  any_executor(const any_executor& e) noexcept;
  any_executor(any_executor&& e) noexcept;
  template<class... OtherSupportableProperties>
    any_executor(any_executor<OtherSupportableProperties...> e);
  template<class... OtherSupportableProperties>
    any_executor(any_executor<OtherSupportableProperties...> e) = delete;
  template<executor Executor>
    any_executor(Executor e);

  any_executor& operator=(const any_executor& e) noexcept;
  any_executor& operator=(any_executor&& e) noexcept;
  any_executor& operator=(nullptr_t) noexcept;
  template<executor Executor>
    any_executor& operator=(Executor e);

  ~any_executor();

  // any_executor modifiers:

  void swap(any_executor& other) noexcept;

  // any_executor operations:

  template <class Property>
  any_executor require(Property) const;

  template <class Property>
  typename Property::polymorphic_query_result_type query(Property) const;

  template<class Function>
    void execute(Function&& f) const;

  // any_executor capacity:

  explicit operator bool() const noexcept;

  // any_executor target access:

  const type_info& target_type() const noexcept;
  template<executor Executor> Executor* target() noexcept;
  template<executor Executor> const Executor* target() const noexcept;
};

// any_executor comparisons:

template <class... SupportableProperties>
bool operator==(const any_executor<SupportableProperties...>& a, const any_executor<SupportableProperties...>& b) noexcept;
template <class... SupportableProperties>
bool operator==(const any_executor<SupportableProperties...>& e, nullptr_t) noexcept;
template <class... SupportableProperties>
bool operator==(nullptr_t, const any_executor<SupportableProperties...>& e) noexcept;
template <class... SupportableProperties>
bool operator!=(const any_executor<SupportableProperties...>& a, const any_executor<SupportableProperties...>& b) noexcept;
template <class... SupportableProperties>
bool operator!=(const any_executor<SupportableProperties...>& e, nullptr_t) noexcept;
template <class... SupportableProperties>
bool operator!=(nullptr_t, const any_executor<SupportableProperties...>& e) noexcept;

// any_executor specialized algorithms:

template <class... SupportableProperties>
void swap(any_executor<SupportableProperties...>& a, any_executor<SupportableProperties...>& b) noexcept;

template <class Property, class... SupportableProperties>
any_executor prefer(const any_executor<SupportableProperties>& e, Property p);
```

The `any_executor` class satisfies the `executor` concept requirements.

[*Note:* To meet the `noexcept` requirements for executor copy constructors and move constructors, implementations may share a target between two or more `any_executor` objects. *--end note*]

Each property type in the `SupportableProperties...` pack shall provide a nested type `polymorphic_query_result_type`.

The *target* is the executor object that is held by the wrapper.

##### `any_executor` constructors

*Effects:* If `*this != nullptr`, releases shared ownership of, or destroys, the target of `*this`.

##### `any_executor` modifiers

```
void swap(any_executor& other) noexcept;

*Remarks:* This function shall not participate in overload resolution unless `FIND_CONVERTIBLE_PROPERTY(Property, SupportableProperties)` is well-formed.

*Returns:* If `std::query(e, p)` is well-formed, `static_cast<Property::polymorphic_query_result_type>(std::query(e, p))`, where `e` is the target object of `*this`. Otherwise, `Property::polymorphic_query_result_type{}`.

```

*Returns:* A polymorphic wrapper whose target is the result of `std::prefer(e, p)`, where `e` is the target object of `*this`.

### Behavioral properties

Behavioral properties define a set of mutually-exclusive nested properties describing executor behavior.

Unless otherwise specified, behavioral property types `S`, their nested property types `S::N`*i*, and nested property objects `S::n`*i* conform to the following specification:

    struct S
    {
      template <class T>
        static constexpr bool is_applicable_property_v = executor<T>;

      static constexpr bool is_requirable = false;
      static constexpr bool is_preferable = false;
      using polymorphic_query_result_type = S;
    
      template<class Executor>
        static constexpr auto static_query_v
          = see-below;
    
      template<class Executor>
      friend constexpr S query(const Executor& ex, const Property& p) noexcept(see-below);
    
      friend constexpr bool operator==(const S& a, const S& b);
      friend constexpr bool operator!=(const S& a, const S& b) { return !operator==(a, b); }
    
      constexpr S();
    
      struct N1
      {
        static constexpr bool is_requirable = true;
        static constexpr bool is_preferable = true;
        using polymorphic_query_result_type = S;
    
        template<class Executor>
          static constexpr auto static_query_v
            = see-below;
    
        static constexpr S value() { return S(N1()); }
      };
    
      static constexpr N1 n1;
    
      constexpr S(const N1);
    
      ...
    
      struct NN
      {
        static constexpr bool is_requirable = true;
        static constexpr bool is_preferable = true;
        using polymorphic_query_result_type = S;
    
        template<class Executor>
          static constexpr auto static_query_v
            = see-below;
    
        static constexpr S value() { return S(NN()); }
      };
    
      static constexpr NN nN;
    
      constexpr S(const NN);
    };

Queries for the value of an executor's behavioral property shall not change between invocations unless the executor is assigned another executor with a different value of that behavioral property.

`S()` and `S(S::E`*i*`())` are all distinct values of `S`. [*Note:* This means they compare unequal. *--end note.*]

The value returned from `std::query(e1, p1)` and a subsequent invocation `std::query(e1, p1)`, where

* `p1` is an instance of `S` or `S::E`*i*, and
* `e2` is the result of `std::require(e1, p2)` or `std::prefer(e1, p2)`,

shall compare equal unless

* `p2` is an instance of `S::E`*i*, and
* `p1` and `p2` are different types.

The value of the expression `S::N1::static_query_v<Executor>` is

* `Executor::query(S::N1())`, if that expression is a well-formed expression;
* ill-formed if `declval<Executor>().query(S::N1())` is well-formed;
* ill-formed if `can_query_v<Executor,S::N`*i*`>` is `true` for any `1 < ` *i* `<= N`;
* otherwise `S::N1()`.

[*Note:* These rules automatically enable the `S::N1` property by default for executors which do not provide a `query` function for properties `S::N`*i*. *--end note*]

The value of the expression `S::N`*i*`::static_query_v<Executor>`, for all `1 < ` *i* `<= N`, is

* `Executor::query(S::N`*i*`())`, if that expression is a well-formed constant expression;
* otherwise ill-formed.

The value of the expression `S::static_query_v<Executor>` is

* `Executor::query(S())`, if that expression is a well-formed constant expression;
* otherwise, ill-formed if `declval<Executor>().query(S())` is well-formed;
* otherwise, `S::N`*i*`::static_query_v<Executor>` for the least *i* `<= N` for which this expression is a well-formed constant expression;
* otherwise ill-formed.

[*Note:* These rules automatically enable the `S::N1` property by default for executors which do not provide a `query` function for properties `S` or `S::N`*i*. *--end note*]

Let *k* be the least value of *i* for which `can_query_v<Executor,S::N`*i*`>` is true, if such a value of *i* exists.

```
template<class Executor>
  friend constexpr S query(const Executor& ex, const Property& p) noexcept(noexcept(std::query(ex, std::declval<const S::Nk>())));
```

*Returns:* `std::query(ex, S::N`*k*`())`.

*Remarks:* This function shall not participate in overload resolution unless `is_same_v<Property,S> && can_query_v<Executor,S::N`*i*`>` is true for at least one `S::N`*i*`. 


```
bool operator==(const S& a, const S& b);
```

*Returns:* `true` if `a` and `b` were constructed from the same constructor; `false`, otherwise.

#### Blocking properties

The `blocking_t` property describes what guarantees executors provide about the blocking behavior of their execution functions.

`blocking_t` provides nested property types and objects as described below.

| Nested Property Type | Nested Property Object Name | Requirements |
|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| `blocking_t::possibly_t` | `blocking.possibly` | Invocation of an executor's execution function may block pending completion of one or more invocations of the submitted function object. |
| `blocking_t::always_t` | `blocking.always` | Invocation of an executor's execution function shall block until completion of all invocations of submitted function object. |
| `blocking_t::never_t` | `blocking.never` | Invocation of an executor's execution function shall not block pending completion of the invocations of the submitted function object. |

##### `blocking_t::always_t` customization points

In addition to conforming to the above specification, the `blocking_t::always_t` property provides the following customization:

    struct always_t
    {
      static constexpr bool is_requirable = true;
      static constexpr bool is_preferable = false;

      template <class T>
        static constexpr bool is_applicable_property_v = executor<T>;

      template<class Executor>
        friend see-below require(Executor ex, blocking_t::always_t);
    };

If the executor has the `blocking_adaptation_t::allowed_t` property, this customization uses an adapter to implement the `blocking_t::always_t` property.

```
template<class Executor>
  friend see-below require(Executor ex, blocking_t::always_t);
```

*Returns:* A value `e1` of type `E1` that holds a copy of `ex`. `E1` provides an overload of `require` such that `e1.require(blocking.always)` returns a copy of `e1`, an overload of `query` such that `std::query(e1,blocking)` returns `blocking.always`, and functions `execute` and `bulk_execute` shall block the calling thread until the submitted functions have finished execution. `e1` has the same executor properties as `ex`, except for the addition of the `blocking_t::always_t` property, and removal of `blocking_t::never_t` and `blocking_t::possibly_t` properties if present.

*Remarks:* This function shall not participate in overload resolution unless `blocking_adaptation_t::static_query_v<Executor>` is `blocking_adaptation.allowed`.

#### Properties to indicate if blocking and directionality may be adapted

The `blocking_adaptation_t` property allows or disallows blocking or directionality adaptation via `std::require`.

`blocking_adaptation_t` provides nested property types and objects as described below.

| Nested Property Type | Nested Property Object Name | Requirements |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|
| `blocking_adaptation_t::disallowed_t` | `blocking_adaptation.disallowed` | The `require` customization point may not adapt the executor to add the `blocking_t::always_t` property. |
| `blocking_adaptation_t::allowed_t` | `blocking_adaptation.allowed` | The `require` customization point may adapt the executor to add the `blocking_t::always_t` property. |

##### `blocking_adaptation_t::allowed_t` customization points

In addition to conforming to the above specification, the `blocking_adaptation_t::allowed_t` property provides the following customization:

    struct allowed_t
    {
      static constexpr bool is_requirable = true;
      static constexpr bool is_preferable = false;

      template <class T>
        static constexpr bool is_applicable_property_v = executor<T>;

      template<class Executor>
        friend see-below require(Executor ex, blocking_adaptation_t::allowed_t);
    };

This customization uses an adapter to implement the `blocking_adaptation_t::allowed_t` property.

```
template<class Executor>
  friend see-below require(Executor ex, blocking_adaptation_t::allowed_t);
```

*Returns:* A value `e1` of type `E1` that holds a copy of `ex`. In addition, `blocking_adaptation_t::static_query_v<E1>` is `blocking_adaptation.allowed`, and `e1.require(blocking_adaptation.disallowed)` yields a copy of `ex`. `e1` has the same executor properties as `ex`, except for the addition of the `blocking_adaptation_t::allowed_t` property.

#### Properties to indicate if submitted tasks represent continuations

The `relationship_t` property allows users of executors to indicate that submitted tasks represent continuations.

`relationship_t` provides nested property types and objects as indicated below.

| Nested Property Type | Nested Property Object Name | Requirements |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|
| `relationship_t::fork_t` | `relationship.fork` | Function objects submitted through the executor do not represent continuations of the caller. |
| `relationship_t::continuation_t` | `relationship.continuation` | Function objects submitted through the executor represent continuations of the caller. Invocation of the submitted function object may be deferred until the caller completes. |

#### Properties to indicate likely task submission in the future

The `outstanding_work_t` property allows users of executors to indicate that task submission is likely in the future.

`outstanding_work_t` provides nested property types and objects as indicated below.

| Nested Property Type| Nested Property Object Name | Requirements |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|
| `outstanding_work_t::untracked_t` | `outstanding_work.untracked` | The existence of the executor object does not indicate any likely future submission of a function object. |
| `outstanding_work_t::tracked_t` | `outstanding_work.tracked` | The existence of the executor object represents an indication of likely future submission of a function object. The executor or its associated execution context may choose to maintain execution resources in anticipation of this submission. |

[*Note:* The `outstanding_work_t::tracked_t` and `outstanding_work_t::untracked_t` properties are used to communicate to the associated execution context intended future work submission on the executor. The intended effect of the properties is the behavior of execution context's facilities for awaiting outstanding work; specifically whether it considers the existance of the executor object with the `outstanding_work_t::tracked_t` property enabled outstanding work when deciding what to wait on. However this will be largely defined by the execution context implementation. It is intended that the execution context will define its wait facilities and on-destruction behaviour and provide an interface for querying this. An initial work towards this is included in P0737r0. *--end note*]

#### Properties for bulk execution guarantees

Bulk execution guarantee properties communicate the forward progress and ordering guarantees of execution agents associated with the bulk execution.

`bulk_guarantee_t` provides nested property types and objects as indicated below.

| Nested Property Type | Nested Property Object Name | Requirements |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|
| `bulk_guarantee_t::unsequenced_t` | `bulk_guarantee.unsequenced` | Execution agents within the same bulk execution may be parallelized and vectorized. |
| `bulk_guarantee_t::sequenced_t` | `bulk_guarantee.sequenced` | Execution agents within the same bulk execution may not be parallelized. |
| `bulk_guarantee_t::parallel_t` | `bulk_guarantee.parallel` | Execution agents within the same bulk execution may be parallelized. |

Execution agents associated with the `bulk_guarantee_t::unsequenced_t` property may invoke the function object in an unordered fashion. Any such invocations in the same thread of execution are unsequenced with respect to each other. [*Note:* This means that multiple execution agents may be interleaved on a single thread of execution, which overrides the usual guarantee from [intro.execution] that function executions do not interleave with one another. *--end note*]

Execution agents associated with the `bulk_guarantee_t::sequenced_t` property invoke the function object in sequence in lexicographic order of their indices.

Execution agents associated with the `bulk_guarantee_t::parallel_t` property invoke the function object with a parallel forward progress guarantee. Any such invocations in the same thread of execution are indeterminately sequenced with respect to each other. [*Note:* It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the invocation does not introduce data races or deadlocks. *--end note*]

[*Editorial note:* The descriptions of these properties were ported from [algorithms.parallel.user]. The intention is that a future standard will specify execution policy behavior in terms of the fundamental properties of their associated executors. We did not include the accompanying code examples from [algorithms.parallel.user] because the examples seem easier to understand when illustrated by `std::for_each`. *--end editorial note*]

#### Properties for mapping of execution on to threads

The `mapping_t` property describes what guarantees executors provide about the mapping of execution agents onto threads of execution.

`mapping_t` provides nested property types and objects as indicated below.

| Nested Property Type| Nested Property Object Name | Requirements |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------|
| `mapping_t::thread_t` | `mapping.thread` | Execution agents are mapped onto threads of execution. |
| `mapping_t::new_thread_t` | `mapping.new_thread` | Each execution agent is mapped onto a new thread of execution. |
| `mapping_t::other_t` | `mapping.other` | Mapping of each execution agent is implementation-defined. |

[*Note:* A mapping of an execution agent onto a thread of execution implies the execution
agent runs as-if on a `std::thread`. Therefore, the facilities provided by
`std::thread`, such as thread-local storage, are available.
`mapping_t::new_thread_t` provides stronger guarantees, in
particular that thread-local storage will not be shared between execution
agents. *--end note*]

### Properties for customizing memory allocation

	template <typename ProtoAllocator>
	struct allocator_t;

The `allocator_t` property conforms to the following specification:

    template <typename ProtoAllocator>
    struct allocator_t
    {
        template <class T>
          static constexpr bool is_applicable_property_v = executor<T>;

        static constexpr bool is_requirable = true;
        static constexpr bool is_preferable = true;
    
        template<class Executor>
        static constexpr auto static_query_v
          = Executor::query(allocator_t);
    
        template <typename OtherProtoAllocator>
        allocator_t<OtherProtoAllocator> operator()(const OtherProtoAllocator &a) const;
    
        static constexpr ProtoAllocator value() const;
    
    private:
        ProtoAllocator a_; // exposition only
    };

| Property | Notes | Requirements |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| `allocator_t<ProtoAllocator>` | Result of `allocator_t<void>::operator(OtherProtoAllocator)`. | The executor shall use the encapsulated allocator to allocate any memory required to store the submitted function object. |
| `allocator_t<void>` | Specialisation of `allocator_t<ProtoAllocator>`. | The executor shall use an implementation defined default allocator to allocate any memory required to store the submitted function object. |

If the expression `std::query(E, P)` is well formed, where `P` is an object of type `allocator_t<ProtoAllocator>`, then:
* the type of the expression `std::query(E, P)` shall satisfy the `ProtoAllocator` requirements;
* the result of the expression `std::query(E, P)` shall be the allocator currently established in the executor `E`; and
* the expression `std::query(E, allocator_t<void>{})` shall also be well formed and have the same result as `std::query(E, P)`.

#### `allocator_t` members

```
template <typename OtherProtoAllocator>
allocator_t<OtherProtoAllocator> operator()(const OtherProtoAllocator &a) const;
```

*Returns:* An allocator object whose exposition-only member `a_` is initialized as `a_(a)`.

*Remarks:* This function shall not participate in overload resolution unless `ProtoAllocator` is `void`.

[*Note:* It is permitted for `a` to be an executor's implementation-defined default allocator and, if so, the default allocator may also be established within an executor by passing the result of this function to `require`. *--end note*]

```
static constexpr ProtoAllocator value() const;
```

*Returns:* The exposition-only member `a_`.

*Remarks:* This function shall not participate in overload resolution unless `ProtoAllocator` is not `void`.

## Executor type traits

### Associated shape type

    template<class Executor>
    struct executor_shape
    {
      private:
        // exposition only
        template<class T>
        using helper = typename T::shape_type;
    
      public:
        using type = std::experimental::detected_or_t<
          size_t, helper, decltype(std::require(declval<const Executor&>(), execution::bulk))
        >;
    
        // exposition only
        static_assert(std::is_integral_v<type>, "shape type must be an integral type");
    };

### Associated index type

    template<class Executor>
    struct executor_index
    {
      private:
        // exposition only
        template<class T>
        using helper = typename T::index_type;
    
      public:
        using type = std::experimental::detected_or_t<
          executor_shape_t<Executor>, helper, decltype(std::require(declval<const Executor&>(), execution::bulk))
        >;
    
        // exposition only
        static_assert(std::is_integral_v<type>, "index type must be an integral type");
    };

## Polymorphic executor support

### Class `bad_executor`

An exception of type `bad_executor` is thrown by polymorphic executor member functions `execute` and `bulk_execute` when the executor object has no target.

```
class bad_executor : public exception
{
public:
  // constructor:
  bad_executor() noexcept;
};
```

#### `bad_executor` constructors

```
bad_executor() noexcept;
```

*Effects:* Constructs a `bad_executor` object.

*Postconditions:* `what()` returns an implementation-defined NTBS.

### Struct `prefer_only`

The `prefer_only` struct is a property adapter that disables the `is_requirable` value.

[*Example:*

Consider a generic function that performs some task immediately if it can, and otherwise asynchronously in the background.

    template<class Executor, class Callback>
    void do_async_work(
        Executor ex,
        Callback callback)
    {
      if (try_work() == done)
      {
        // Work completed immediately, invoke callback.
        std::require(ex,
            execution::single,
            execution::oneway,
          ).execute(callback);
      }
      else
      {
        // Perform work in background. Track outstanding work.
        start_background_work(
            std::prefer(ex,
              execution::outstanding_work.tracked),
            callback);
      }
    }

This function can be used with an inline executor which is defined as follows:

    struct inline_executor
    {
      constexpr bool operator==(const inline_executor&) const noexcept
      {
        return true;
      }
    
      constexpr bool operator!=(const inline_executor&) const noexcept
      {
        return false;
      }
    
      template<class Function> void execute(Function f) const noexcept
      {
        f();
      }
    };

as, in the case of an unsupported property, invocation of `std::prefer` will fall back to an identity operation.

The polymorphic `executor` wrapper should be able to simply swap in, so that we could change `do_async_work` to the non-template function:

    void do_async_work(
        executor<
          execution::single,
          execution::oneway,
          execution::outstanding_work_t::tracked_t> ex,
        std::function<void()> callback)
    {
      if (try_work() == done)
      {
        // Work completed immediately, invoke callback.
        std::require(ex,
            execution::single,
            execution::oneway,
          ).execute(callback);
      }
      else
      {
        // Perform work in background. Track outstanding work.
        start_background_work(
            std::prefer(ex,
              execution::outstanding_work.tracked),
            callback);
      }
    }

with no change in behavior or semantics.

However, if we simply specify `execution::outstanding_work.tracked` in the `executor` template parameter list, we will get a compile error due to the `executor` template not knowing that `execution::outstanding_work.tracked` is intended for use with `prefer` only. At the point of construction from an `inline_executor` called `ex`, `executor` will try to instantiate implementation templates that perform the ill-formed `std::require(ex, execution::outstanding_work.tracked)`.

The `prefer_only` adapter addresses this by turning off the `is_requirable` attribute for a specific property. It would be used in the above example as follows:

    void do_async_work(
        executor<
          execution::single,
          execution::oneway,
          prefer_only<execution::outstanding_work_t::tracked_t>> ex,
        std::function<void()> callback)
    {
      ...
    }

*-- end example*]

    template<class InnerProperty>
    struct prefer_only
    {
      InnerProperty property;
    
      static constexpr bool is_requirable = false;
      static constexpr bool is_preferable = InnerProperty::is_preferable;
    
      using polymorphic_query_result_type = see-below; // not always defined
    
      template<class Executor>
        static constexpr auto static_query_v = see-below; // not always defined
    
      constexpr prefer_only(const InnerProperty& p);
    
      constexpr auto value() const
        noexcept(noexcept(std::declval<const InnerProperty>().value()))
          -> decltype(std::declval<const InnerProperty>().value());
    
      template<class Executor, class Property>
      friend auto prefer(Executor ex, const Property& p)
        noexcept(noexcept(std::prefer(std::move(ex), std::declval<const InnerProperty>())))
          -> decltype(std::prefer(std::move(ex), std::declval<const InnerProperty>()));
    
      template<class Executor, class Property>
      friend constexpr auto query(const Executor& ex, const Property& p)
        noexcept(noexcept(std::query(ex, std::declval<const InnerProperty>())))
          -> decltype(std::query(ex, std::declval<const InnerProperty>()));
    };

If `InnerProperty::polymorphic_query_result_type` is valid and denotes a type, the template instantiation `prefer_only<InnerProperty>` defines a nested type `polymorphic_query_result_type` as a synonym for `InnerProperty::polymorphic_query_result_type`.

If `InnerProperty::static_query_v` is a variable template and `InnerProperty::static_query_v<E>` is well formed for some executor type `E`, the template instantiation `prefer_only<InnerProperty>` defines a nested variable template `static_query_v` as a synonym for `InnerProperty::static_query_v`.

```
constexpr prefer_only(const InnerProperty& p);
```

*Effects:* Initializes `property` with `p`.

```
constexpr auto value() const
  noexcept(noexcept(std::declval<const InnerProperty>().value()))
    -> decltype(std::declval<const InnerProperty>().value());
```

*Returns:* `property.value()`.

*Remarks:* Shall not participate in overload resolution unless the expression `property.value()` is well-formed.

```
template<class Executor, class Property>
friend auto prefer(Executor ex, const Property& p)
  noexcept(noexcept(std::prefer(std::move(ex), std::declval<const InnerProperty>())))
    -> decltype(std::prefer(std::move(ex), std::declval<const InnerProperty>()));
```

*Returns:* `std::prefer(std::move(ex), p.property)`.

*Remarks:* Shall not participate in overload resolution unless `std::is_same_v<Property, prefer_only>` is `true`, and the expression `std::prefer(std::move(ex), p.property)` is well-formed.

```
template<class Executor, class Property>
friend constexpr auto query(const Executor& ex, const Property& p)
  noexcept(noexcept(std::query(ex, std::declval<const InnerProperty>())))
    -> decltype(std::query(ex, std::declval<const InnerProperty>()));
```

*Returns:* `std::query(ex, p.property)`.

*Remarks:* Shall not participate in overload resolution unless `std::is_same_v<Property, prefer_only>` is `true`, and the expression `std::query(ex, p.property)` is well-formed.

## Thread pools

Thread pools manage execution agents which run on threads without incurring the
overhead of thread creation and destruction whenever such agents are needed.

### Header `<thread_pool>` synopsis

```
namespace std {

  class static_thread_pool;

} // namespace std
```

### Class `static_thread_pool`

`static_thread_pool` is a statically-sized thread pool which may be explicitly
grown via thread attachment. The `static_thread_pool` is expected to be created
with the use case clearly in mind with the number of threads known by the
creator. As a result, no default constructor is considered correct for
arbitrary use cases and `static_thread_pool` does not support any form of
automatic resizing.   

`static_thread_pool` presents an effectively unbounded input queue and the execution functions of `static_thread_pool`'s associated executors do not block on this input queue.

[*Note:* Because `static_thread_pool` represents work as parallel execution agents,
situations which require concurrent execution properties are not guaranteed
correctness. *--end note.*]

```
class static_thread_pool
{
  public:
    using scheduler_type = see-below;
    using executor_type = see-below;
    
    // construction/destruction
    explicit static_thread_pool(std::size_t num_threads);
    
    // nocopy
    static_thread_pool(const static_thread_pool&) = delete;
    static_thread_pool& operator=(const static_thread_pool&) = delete;

    // stop accepting incoming work and wait for work to drain
    ~static_thread_pool();

    // attach current thread to the thread pools list of worker threads
    void attach();

    // signal all work to complete
    void stop();

    // wait for all threads in the thread pool to complete
    void wait();

    // placeholder for a general approach to getting schedulers from 
    // standard contexts.
    scheduler_type scheduler() noexcept;

    // placeholder for a general approach to getting executors from 
    // standard contexts.
    executor_type executor() noexcept;
};
```

For an object of type `static_thread_pool`, *outstanding work* is defined as the sum
of:

* the number of existing executor objects associated with the
  `static_thread_pool` for which the `execution::outstanding_work.tracked` property is
  established;

* the number of function objects that have been added to the `static_thread_pool`
  via the `static_thread_pool` executor, scheduler and sender, but not yet invoked; and

* the number of function objects that are currently being invoked within the
  `static_thread_pool`.

The `static_thread_pool` member functions `scheduler`, `executor`, `attach`, 
`wait`, and `stop`, and the associated schedulers', senders` and executors' copy 
constructors and member functions, do not introduce data races as a result of 
concurrent invocations of those functions from different threads of execution.

A `static_thread_pool`'s threads run execution agents with forward progress guarantee delegation. [*Note:* Forward progress is delegated to an execution agent for its lifetime. Because `static_thread_pool` guarantees only parallel forward progress to running execution agents; _i.e._, execution agents which have run the first step of the function object. *--end note*]

#### Types

```
using scheduler_type = see-below;
```

A scheduler type conforming to the specification for `static_thread_pool` scheduler types described below.

```
using executor_type = see-below;
```

An executor type conforming to the specification for `static_thread_pool` executor types described below.

#### Construction and destruction

```
static_thread_pool(std::size_t num_threads);
```

*Effects:* Constructs a `static_thread_pool` object with `num_threads` threads of
execution, as if by creating objects of type `std::thread`.

```
~static_thread_pool();
```

*Effects:* Destroys an object of class `static_thread_pool`. Performs `stop()`
followed by `wait()`.

#### Worker management

```
void attach();
```

*Effects:* Adds the calling thread to the pool such that this thread is used to
execute submitted function objects. [*Note:* Threads created during thread pool
construction, or previously attached to the pool, will continue to be used for
function object execution. *--end note*] Blocks the calling thread until
signalled to complete by `stop()` or `wait()`, and then blocks until all the
threads created during `static_thread_pool` object construction have completed.
(NAMING: a possible alternate name for this function is `join()`.)

```
void stop();
```

*Effects:* Signals the threads in the pool to complete as soon as possible. If
a thread is currently executing a function object, the thread will exit only
after completion of that function object. Invocation of `stop()` returns without
waiting for the threads to complete. Subsequent invocations to attach complete
immediately.

```
void wait();
```

*Effects:* If not already stopped, signals the threads in the pool to complete
once the outstanding work is `0`. Blocks the calling thread (C++Std
[defns.block]) until all threads in the pool have completed, without executing
submitted function objects in the calling thread. Subsequent invocations of `attach()`
complete immediately.

*Synchronization:* The completion of each thread in the pool synchronizes with
(C++Std [intro.multithread]) the corresponding successful `wait()` return.

#### Scheduler creation

```
scheduler_type scheduler() noexcept;
```

*Returns:* A scheduler that may be used to create sender objects that may be 
used to submit receiver objects to the thread pool. The returned scheduler has 
the following properties already established:

  * `execution::allocator`
  * `execution::allocator(std::allocator<void>())`

#### Executor creation

```
executor_type executor() noexcept;
```

*Returns:* An executor that may be used to submit function objects to the
thread pool. The returned executor has the following properties already
established:

  * `execution::oneway`
  * `execution::blocking.possibly`
  * `execution::relationship.fork`
  * `execution::outstanding_work.untracked`
  * `execution::allocator`
  * `execution::allocator(std::allocator<void>())`

### `static_thread_pool` scheduler types

All scheduler types accessible through `static_thread_pool::scheduler()`, and subsequent invocations of the member function `require`, conform to the following specification.

```
class C
{
  public:

    // types:

    using sender_type = see-below;

    // construct / copy / destroy:

    C(const C& other) noexcept;
    C(C&& other) noexcept;

    C& operator=(const C& other) noexcept;
